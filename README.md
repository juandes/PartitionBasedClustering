# Partition Based Clustering

The Partition Based Clustering project aims to provide a Go solution to some of the most common
partition based clustering method. This project is meant to be a proof of concept, meaning that the
code is not fully optimized, it needs more tests, and it has not being used in production; my
original motivation with this is to fully understand how these algorithms work by implementing them.


## The algorithms
***
The following algorithms are implemented:

- K-Means
- K-Medoids

## Future work
***
- Implement cluster validations techniques
- Calculate both the intra/intercluster distance
- Explicity specify how verbose the outputs are (currently there is a lot being printed)
